## Electric Guest

With some artists as soon as I hear one song I immediately download the album and listen to the whole thing. Electric Guest's 2nd album _Plural_ is amazing all the way through and has been a favourite of mine as soon as I heard _Oh Devil_.

For their first album, _Mondo_, I feel their style hadn't yet evolved into what I love but they still have some great tracks.

#### My favourites
- Oh Devil
- Back & Forth
-


## Poolside

Poolside is another artist once discovered I couldn't stop listening. He fuses upbeat dance with chilled out beats somehow managing to make the tracks both energising and relaxing.

#### My favourites
- Leila (Poolside Remix)
- Feel Alright
- Strange Overtones
- Drifting


## Big Data

Self-labled as 'Paranoid electronic _CHECK_', Big Data creates amazingly produced music set around the potential harm of tech. Eg Big Dater about false personas people portray for online dating sites.


## Arcade High

#### My favourites
- Phone Lines
- Full Hearts
- Cool Inc.




## Aeroplane

Funky Belgian beats

#### My favourites
- Love On Hold



## Night Runner

Originally recommended to me by Dan Avidan on Game Grumps. He later collaborated with them for their second album in _Magnum Bullets_ which was nice to see :) (I bet they noticed the 'Grump Bump')

#### My favourites
- Murder in Miami
- The Driver
- The Sentinels


## Magic Sword

The pinnacle of 80s throwback electronic. _In The Face Of Evil_ was featured as the trailer song for _Thor: Ragnarok_. It took me a while to realise that was the song

#### My favourites
- In The Face Of Evil
- The Curse
- Sword of Light

## Delta Heavy

## Public Service Broadcasting



## LCD Soundsystem


## Neon Indian


## Brookes Brothers


## Marc Rebillet


## Hybrid Minds

## Escort

Escort is a strange one for me because I kinda dislike a lot of their songs but a couple I really love.

#### My favourites
- If You Say So


## Breakbot

## Cut Copy

## DJ Cutman

...His Zelda: Link's Awakening remixes are excellent are essentially what was playing in my head after being tens of hours deep in the game jamming away to the already awesome tunes. (Thanks Koji Kondo). I'm making my own clone of Link's Awakening and I'm planning to make the music customisable so some of his will be available (watch that space?)...
